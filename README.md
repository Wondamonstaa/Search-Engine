# Search-Engine
The following project is a simplified version of the technology underpinning Spotlight, Google, and Bing.

Search engines are one of the most influential developments of the modern internet age, having completely revolutionized the way that people use and interact with the web. What was once an intractable jumble of data with no semblance of organization has been transformed into an easily searchable repository of information. In this project, you will recreate this phenomenal technological development by using the map and set abstractions to build a document search engine that can find matching pages for a user's query with lightning-fast response time. This is a simplified version of the technology underpinning Spotlight, Google, Bing, and every other modern search engine that you encounter in your day-to-day internet use.

In this version of the search engine, each web page has a URL that serves as its unique id and a string containing the body text of the page. The magic of search is enabled by pre-processing the body text of each page and storing the contents into a data structure optimized for fast retrieval of pages matching the search query.
